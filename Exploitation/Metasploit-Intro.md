### Metasploit: Introduction
- Open-source penetration testing framework
- includes a database of known vulnerabilities and tools/scripts for exploiting
- Metasploit Pro: commercial version, has GUI, automation of tasks
- Metasploit Framework: command line tool, focuses on manual testing
- `msfconsole` for main interface
___
### Modules
- usually inside `/opt/metasploit-framework/embedded/framework/modules#`
  - tip: `tree -L [folder]` to display only 1 level of the folder
- Auxiliary: supporting modules, like scanners, crawlers, fuzzers
- Encoders: encodes the exploit and payload hoping that a signature-based antivirus solution may miss them, however some antiviruses have dectections that detects the behavior, not just the code itself
- Evasion: will try to trick the security system into thinking the attack is harmless, or legit, however it still can be detected
- Exploits: exploits
- NOPs (No OPeration): do nothing, used as a buffer to achieve consistent payload sizes, makes exploits more reliable by accommodating slight variations in memory addresses
- Payloads: codes run on the target system, to achieve the desired result
  - Adapters: Wrap single payloads into different formats (e.g., PowerShell commands).
  - Singles: Self-contained payloads (e.g., add user, launch notepad) needing no extra downloads.
  - Stagers: Create a connection for staged payloads, sending a small initial payload.
  - Stages: Larger payloads downloaded by the stager after setup.
  - if the payload has "_" (incline) means single payload
  - if the payload has "/" means staged payload
- Post: used after gaining access to a target system, (ex: dump passwords, collect files, etc...)
