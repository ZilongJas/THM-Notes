### OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model: How communications should occur in a computer network.

`"Please Do Not Throw Spinach Pizza Away"`
1. Physical Layer (Layer 1): Physical connection between devices, such as wire, and binary digits 0 and 1.
2. Data Link Layer (Layer 2): Makes sure data moves smoothly and accurately between devices on a local network.
3. Network Layer (Layer 3): Sending data between different networks across the world.
4. Transport Layer (Layer 4): Ensuring data is sent, received, and reassembled correctly.
5. Session Layer (Layer 5): Manages and maintains connections or sessions between 2 devices on a network.
6. Presentation Layer (Layer 6): Responsible for translating data into a format that the application layer can understand.
7. Application Layer (Layer 7): Interacts with end-user applications. Providing services and interfaces.

### TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) model: Created by Department of Defense in 1970s.
- Application (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, POP3, SMTP, IMAP, Telnet, SSH) 
- Transport (TCP,UDP)
- Network (IP,ICMP,IPSec)
- Link (Ethernet, WiFi)
- Physical

___

### IP and Subnets
3 ranges of private IP addresses:
- 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (10/8)
- 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (172.16/12)
- 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168/16)
___

### UDP and TCP
port number ranges between 1-65535

- UDP: Fast, but unreliable since it skips checks. (EX: Streaming, gaming, online calls)
- TCP: Ensures data gets to where it's going, in the right order. It sets up a connection, checks if each chunk of data arrives, and resends any that get lost.
