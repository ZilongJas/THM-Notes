- `-sU` UDP scan, scans for open UDP ports
- `-sT` TCP scan, scans for open TCP ports, completes the handshake
  - `-sN` TCP Null Scan: sends packets with no TCP flags
    - open/filtered ports: no response
    - closed ports: respond with RST
  - `-sF` TCP FIN Scan: sends packets with only FIN flag set
    - open/filtered ports: no response

    - more detectable
- `O` detect target operating system
- `sV` detect version of services
- `v` verbose, more info, add more v's for more info
- `-oA` saves the output in 3 major formats at once so you don't have to rescan the target
- `-oN` saves nmap result in a normal format
- `oG` saves nmap ressult in a grepable format
- `-A` agressive mode, scans for OS, service, traceroute, and scripts
- `-T5` increase speed at level 5, [0-5], 0 being slowest
- `-p [port]` scan a specific port
- `-p [port-port]` scan ports with a range
- `-p-` scans all ports
- `--script` activate a script from nmap scripting library
- `--script=vuln` activate all scripts in vuln category
