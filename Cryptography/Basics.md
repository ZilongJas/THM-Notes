### Symmetric Encryption
- uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt the data
- DES: 56-bit key encryption cracked in 1999, leading to the adoption of 3DES.
- 3DES: Provides 112-bit security, was deprecated in 2019.
- AES: Adopted in 2001 with 128, 192, or 256-bit keys, replacing DES and 3DES.
___
### Asymmetric Encryption
- uses a pair of keys, one to encrypt and the other to decrypt
- RSA: A widely used encryption algorithm relying on the difficulty of factoring large prime numbers. Commonly used for secure data transmission.
- ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography): An encryption method that uses elliptic curves for smaller, efficient keys, providing similar security to RSA with smaller key sizes.
- Diffie-Hellman: A key exchange method allowing two parties to securely generate a shared secret over an insecure channel, forming the basis of many encryption protocols.
___
### XOR Operation (exclusive OR)

- similar to a truth table
___
### Modulo Operation (% or mod)
- the remainder (like a math problem)
