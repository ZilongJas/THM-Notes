### Scanning 
- first enter `msfconsole`
- ```bash
  search portscan
  ```
  - list potential port scanning modules
  - ```bash
    use #
    ```
  - ```bash
    show options
    ```
    - CONCURRENCY: Number of targets to be scanned simultaneously.
    - PORTS: Port range to be scanned. Please note that 1-1000 here will not be the same as using Nmap with the default configuration. Nmap will scan the 1000 most used ports, while Metasploit will scan port numbers from 1 to 10000.
    - RHOSTS: Target or target network to be scanned.
    - THREADS: Number of threads that will be used simultaneously. More threads will result in faster scans.
