### Auto Cracking
- `john [options] [file path]`
- automatic cracking `john --wordlist=[path to wordlist] [path to file]` detects the hash type, but it is not reliable

### links
- https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/hash-identifier/-/tree/kali/master
  - `wget https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/hash-identifier/-/raw/kali/master/hash-id.py`
- https://hashes.com/en/tools/hash_identifier
___
### Format-Specific Cracking
- `john --format=[format] --wordlist=[path to wordlist] [path to file]`
- `john --list=formats ` to list all formats
  - EX: `grep -iF "md5"`
    - `-i` insenstitive
    - `F` exact text match
- Use `raw-` formats when working with basic, unsalted hashes without additional formatting. Ex `raw-md5`
___
### Windows Authentication Hashes (NTHash / NTLM)
- NThash: is the hash format modern Windows operating system machines use to store user and service passwords.
- `nt` new technology is the format
___
### /etc/shadow hashes
- `unshadow [path to passwd] [path to shadow]`
  - combines the contents of /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow into a single format
- Ex: `unshadow local_passwd local_shadow > unshadowed.txt`
___ 
### Single Crack Mode
- Word mangling: only uses the username to try and work out possible passwords that way
- `john --single --format=[format] [path to file]`
- in the hashes text file, add the username then a colon before the hash
  - EX: `mike:5123125123asd1241d`
___
### Custom Rules
- `john.conf` usually located in /etc/john/john.conf

___
### Zip2John
- `zip2john [options] [zip file] > [output file]` turns the zip into a hask file that john can understand
___
### Rar2John
- `rar2john [rar file] > [output file]`
___
### SSH Keys (SSH2John)
- id_rsa is the filename for a private key generated by SSH
- `ssh2john [id_rsa private key file] > [output file]`
- if ssh2john does not exist, use the python file located in john/ (ssh2john.py)
