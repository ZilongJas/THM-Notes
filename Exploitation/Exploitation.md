### Scanning 
- first enter `msfconsole`
- ```bash
  search portscan
  ```
- list potential port scanning modules
- ```bash
   use #
   ```
- in this case, we are using `scanner/portscan/tcp`
- ```bash
  show options
  ```
    - CONCURRENCY: Number of targets to be scanned simultaneously.
    - PORTS: Port range to be scanned. Please note that 1-1000 here will not be the same as using Nmap with the default configuration. Nmap will scan the 1000 most used ports, while Metasploit will scan port numbers from 1 to 10000.
    - RHOSTS: Target or target network to be scanned.
    - THREADS: Number of threads that will be used simultaneously. More threads will result in faster scans.
- nmap works inside the msfconsole

### scanner/discovery/udp_sweep
- this module will allow you to quickly identify services running over the UDP (User Datagram Protocol). This module will not conduct an extensive scan of all possible UDP services but does provide a quick way to identify services such as DNS or NetBIOS.
- ```bash
  set RHOSTS [target_ip]
  ```
  - set the target ip
- ```bash
    run
  ```
  - runs the scanner
